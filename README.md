Questions that came up during the site build:

- Hero Section
  1. Is there a better way to handle the floating icons than a relative position container and absolute position items?
  <!--  -->
- Why Front? Section
  1. The only way I could get the bubble components to not overlap was to set a width for each bubble item. Is this the best way of accomplishing this section, or would there be a property that could accomplish this better?
  - I tried justification properties on the flex container, but everything left a gap between the lines, or cause significant overlap unless paired with a set width.
